# Storybox - Component-Driven Development with Storybook

![Storybox Demo](storybox-demo.gif)

A comprehensive demonstration of **Component-Driven Development (CDD)** using Storybook, showcasing modern React development practices with accessibility-first design, comprehensive testing, and cross-browser compatibility.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the power of **Component-Driven Development** by building a task management application from the ground up using isolated, tested, and documented components. It showcases how Storybook enables teams to build robust UIs with confidence.

### What This Project Demonstrates

**🧩 Component-Driven Development (CDD)**

- Build components in isolation before integrating into pages
- Develop UI components outside the context of business logic
- Create a comprehensive component library with documentation
- Enable parallel development between frontend and backend teams

**♿ Accessibility-First Development**

- Built-in accessibility testing with Storybook's a11y addon
- ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast validation

**🔧 Modern Development Practices**

- TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Redux Toolkit for predictable state management
- Mock Service Worker (MSW) for API mocking and testing
- Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- Comprehensive testing strategies

## � Features Implemented

### Core Components

- **Task Component**: Individual task items with state management (inbox, pinned, archived)
- **TaskList Component**: Collection of tasks with loading and empty states
- **InboxScreen Component**: Full page component integrating Redux store and API calls

### Storybook Integration

- **Comprehensive Stories**: Each component has multiple stories showcasing different states
- **Interactive Controls**: Storybook controls for dynamic component testing
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated docs with component props and usage examples
- **Accessibility Testing**: Built-in a11y addon for accessibility validation

### Advanced Features

- **Mock Service Worker (MSW)**: API mocking for development and testing
- **Redux Integration**: State management with Redux Toolkit
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across the application
- **Cross-browser Support**: Tested and working in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox
- **Responsive Design**: Components work across different screen sizes

## � Prerequisites

This project uses **Yarn 4.5.0** as the package manager, managed through **Corepack** (the recommended approach for modern Yarn).

### Install Yarn 4.5.0 using Corepack

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 16.10+ (Corepack is included with Node.js)

**1. Enable Corepack (if not already enabled):**

```bash
corepack enable
```

**2. The project will automatically use Yarn 4.5.0** when you run yarn commands (configured in `package.json`)

**If Corepack is not available on your system:**

**macOS/Linux:**

```bash
# Update Node.js to 16.10+ (includes Corepack)
# Using nvm (recommended)
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts

# Or install Corepack separately if needed
npm install -g corepack
corepack enable
```

**Windows:**

```bash
# Update Node.js to 16.10+ from nodejs.org
# Or install Corepack separately if needed
npm install -g corepack
corepack enable
```

**Why Corepack?**

- **Automatic version management**: No need to manually install/update Yarn
- **Project-specific versions**: Each project uses its specified Yarn version
- **Zero global installs**: Yarn is managed per-project
- **Official recommendation**: This is the modern way to use Yarn v4+

## 🚅 Quick start

1.  **Clone the repository**

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/votoznotna/storybox.git
    cd storybox
    ```

1.  **Install dependencies**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and install the necessary dependencies.

    ```shell
    yarn install
    ```

1.  **Start the development server**

    ```shell
    # Start the main application
    yarn dev
    ```

1.  **Browse your stories!**

    Run `yarn storybook` to see your component's stories at `http://localhost:6006`

1.  **View your application**
    - Main app: `http://localhost:5173`
    - Storybook: `http://localhost:6006`

## 🎯 Component-Driven Development Benefits

### Why CDD with Storybook?

**🔧 Isolated Development**

- Build components in isolation without worrying about app-specific dependencies
- Focus on component API design and reusability
- Catch edge cases early by testing components in various states

**📚 Living Documentation**

- Auto-generated documentation that stays in sync with code
- Interactive examples that designers and stakeholders can review
- Component API documentation with TypeScript integration

**🧪 Enhanced Testing**

- Visual regression testing capabilities
- Accessibility testing built into the development workflow
- Easy testing of component states and edge cases

**👥 Team Collaboration**

- Shared component library that entire team can reference
- Design system consistency across the application
- Parallel development between frontend and backend teams

## ♿ Accessibility-First Development

### Built-in Accessibility Features

**🔍 Automated Testing**

- Storybook a11y addon automatically checks for accessibility violations
- Real-time feedback during development
- WCAG 2.1 compliance validation

**⌨️ Keyboard Navigation**

- Full keyboard accessibility for all interactive elements
- Proper focus management and tab order
- Screen reader compatibility

**🎨 Visual Accessibility**

- Color contrast validation
- Support for high contrast modes
- Scalable text and responsive design

**🏷️ Semantic HTML**

- Proper ARIA labels and roles
- Semantic HTML structure
- Meaningful alt text for images

### Accessibility Testing Workflow

1. **Development**: a11y addon provides real-time feedback
2. **Review**: Accessibility violations are highlighted in Storybook
3. **Testing**: Manual testing with screen readers and keyboard navigation
4. **Documentation**: Accessibility considerations documented in stories
